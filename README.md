===============

Google / 2 Factor Authentication Automation Tool (gauth)

Please run perldoc gauth  or /opt/gauth/gauth --help for more information

The initial name for this tool was gauth but it is being extended to include more 2 factor authentication methods and will eventually be renamed to g2auth, but currently is being called gauth

The LDAP module has been truncated and does not currently work, this is being fixed, so currently LDAP should be disabled within the configuration files.
